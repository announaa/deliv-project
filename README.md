 Regional E-commerce website with Delivery System.

Using laravel framework i build this website to get regions in my country to be able to share their business online and take care of the delivery of bought items.
it consist also on offering jobs to any person that have a vehicul and want to have extra money on their free time.
i begin with this website and it is quite satisfiable to the needs of e-commerce shoppers 
but the missing piece of puzzle in this project is the communication between store shopper and delivery guy which is gonna be with whatsapp api.
we all know that not every one have knowledge about technology and cant count on any person to be able to work with complicated systems so the idea was to take advantage of the popularity of whatsapp and use its api to achieve the communication.


Understand the project : 

as a user : 

visit the website.
consult items and shop as a guest.
register and login to be able to buy.
you can become a delivery guy with the special feature of every user.
there is the add to cart feature to buy multiple order.
there is the add to wish list to be able to get back to the considered item quickly.
and in the profile page there are the pending orderes and the confirmed ones. 

as a delivery guy : 

all user features are available.
you can check your work stats including daliy and monthly delivery made and check balance and rating 

as an admin : 

the plan was to offer to the admin the chance to help users with creating there account and stores and accept the work requests but these are not implemented yet.
